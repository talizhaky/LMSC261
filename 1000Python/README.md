# Creating a Foursquare

This project wasn't entirely difficult, it was pretty straight forward actually.
All I did was define three variables:
1) The line that looked like "+----+" (X)
2) The line that looked like "|      |" (Y)
3) Putting those two together to form the square (print_square)

The hardest part was decide to either relearn Python and disregard what I learned in March or to try to remember how to do everything that way. It was a slight learning curve but in the end I was able to combine what I knew about Python and what I just learned to be able to use it.

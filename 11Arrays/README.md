# Pyramid Assignment

Maaaannn this one was hard. On Monday (during class), I set up an office hour with Rachel cause I had little faith in figuring it out. However, I sat down with the computer and good ol' Google and tried to familiarize myself with the C  language. Adding comments throughout the code explaining what things do was helpful. I'm familiar with Python so I was really trying to compare the two. Not even 5 minutes later I figured out how to make the pyramid!

This is for Intro to Programming Fall 2020.
I'm slightly confused to be quite honest.


# **WHAT IS CODE by Paul Ford**
## **1 - The Man in the Taupe Blazer**
- High executive is now in charge of rebuilding the company's website and managing coders. He is frustrated cause if something goes wrong, it’s his head getting cut off.
### *1.1 - Why are We Here?*
- 11 million software developers in the world
  - 7 million hobbyists
- This is Ford's view of software development, as an individual among millions.
## **2 - Let's Begin**
### *2.1 - How Do You Type an "A"?*
- Computer waits for a signal from the keyboard. When the key is pressed, the computer interprets it and passes it farther into its own interior.
- Coders are willing to work backwards to that key press.
### *2.2 - From Hardware to Software*
- If coders don’t run the world, they run the things that run the world.
- Hardware used to be separate from software (buy and computer + the software separately), but now when you buy a computer it comes with all the functions already installed.
### *2.3 - How does Code Become Software?*
- Code: a sequence of symbols that someone typed in, or copied, or pasted from elsewhere. Software developers are handed a problem, think about the problem, write code that will solve the problem, and then expect the computer to turn words into deeds.
- Goal is to turn your code into an explicit list of instructions that can be carried out by interconnected logic gates (software)
- A compiler: software that takes the symbols you typed into a file and transforms them into lower-level instructions.
- Every single character matters. A small mistake can leave your computer in a state of panic.
### *2.4 - What is an Algorithm?*
- An algorithm solves a problem.
- Euclid’s algorithm page.
- A programming language is a system for encoding, naming, and organizing algorithms for reuse and application. An algorithm management system.
- The hardest work in programming is getting around things that aren't computable.
- Programming languages have 2 jobs
  1. Wrap up lots of algorithms so they can be reused.
  2. Make it easy for programmers to wrap up new algorithms and routines into functions for reuse.
- The DRY principle: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Name things once, do things once, create a function once, and let the computer repeat itself.
### *2.5 - The Sprint*
- Wireframe mock-ups: pictures of how the website will look.
### *2.6 - What's With all These Conferences, Anyway?*
- Technology conferences are where primate Dynamics can be fully displayed, we're relationships of power and hierarchy can be established.
- There were loads of sexual misconduct against women. They started documenting it, and now there are rules and codes of conduct for people to follow.
- Less than 30% of people in Computing are women, the number of women in Computing has fallen since the 80s
## **3 - Why Are Programmers So Intense About Languages?**
- As of April 15, 20__ the most used computer languages were: Java, C, C++, Objective-C, and C#. Followed by: JavaScript, PHP, and Python.
### *3.1 - The Beauty of the Standard Library*
- A language is a software for making software.
- The standard library is a set of premade software that you can reuse and reapply.
  - Python comes with tons of preexisting code organized into “modules” that you can reuse.
### *3.2 - What Do Different Languages Do?*
- Different codes structure data in different ways and address the components of the computer in different ways.
### *3.3 - The Importance of C*
- C is a big deal
- It’s the principle development language of the UNIX operating system
- C is computing like Latin is to Renaissance Academics
### *3.4 - The Corporate Object Revolution*
- Object-oriented programming is a filing system for code
- Object-oriented programming gave programmers a great way to name things
- Java is an object-oriented language, influenced by C++, that runs on a virtual machine (just like Smalltalk).
- Objective-C, per its name, jammed C and Smalltalk together with no apologies.
- C# (pronounced “C sharp”) is based on C and influenced by Java, but it was created by Microsoft for use in its .NET framework.
- C++ is an object-oriented version of C, although its roots are more in Simula.
### *3.5 - Look How Big and Weird Things Get With Just Python*
- Python has a reputation as a “glue language”
  - You can take code from other lower-level languages (like C, C++, Fortran 77) and write “wrapper functions”.
    - Embed the older, faster code in the newer slower, but easier-to-use system (Python)

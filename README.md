# LMSC261
This is for Intro to Programming Fall 2020.
I'm slightly confused to be quite honest.


# **WHAT IS CODE by Paul Ford**
## **1 - The Man in the Taupe Blazer**
- High executive is now in charge of rebuilding the company's website and managing coders. He is frustrated cause if something goes wrong, it’s his head getting cut off.
### *1.1 - Why are We Here?*
- 11 million software developers in the world
  - 7 million hobbyists
- This is Ford's view of software development, as an individual among millions.
## **2 - Let's Begin**
### *2.1 - How Do You Type an "A"?*
- Computer waits for a signal from the keyboard. When the key is pressed, the computer interprets it and passes it farther into its own interior.
- Coders are willing to work backwards to that key press.
### *2.2 - From Hardware to Software*
- If coders don’t run the world, they run the things that run the world.
- Hardware used to be separate from software (buy and computer + the software separately), but now when you buy a computer it comes with all the functions already installed.
### *2.3 - How does Code Become Software?*
- Code: a sequence of symbols that someone typed in, or copied, or pasted from elsewhere. Software developers are handed a problem, think about the problem, write code that will solve the problem, and then expect the computer to turn words into deeds.
- Goal is to turn your code into an explicit list of instructions that can be carried out by interconnected logic gates (software)
- A compiler: software that takes the symbols you typed into a file and transforms them into lower-level instructions.
- Every single character matters. A small mistake can leave your computer in a state of panic.
### *2.4 - What is an Algorithm?*
- An algorithm solves a problem.
- Euclid’s algorithm page.
- A programming language is a system for encoding, naming, and organizing algorithms for reuse and application. An algorithm management system.
- The hardest work in programming is getting around things that aren't computable.
- Programming languages have 2 jobs
  1. Wrap up lots of algorithms so they can be reused.
  2. Make it easy for programmers to wrap up new algorithms and routines into functions for reuse.
- The DRY principle: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Name things once, do things once, create a function once, and let the computer repeat itself.
### *2.5 - The Sprint*
- Wireframe mock-ups: pictures of how the website will look.
### *2.6 - What's With all These Conferences, Anyway?*
- Technology conferences are where primate Dynamics can be fully displayed, we're relationships of power and hierarchy can be established.
- There were loads of sexual misconduct against women. They started documenting it, and now there are rules and codes of conduct for people to follow.
- Less than 30% of people in Computing are women, the number of women in Computing has fallen since the 80s
## **3 - Why Are Programmers So Intense About Languages?**
- As of April 15, 20__ the most used computer languages were: Java, C, C++, Objective-C, and C#. Followed by: JavaScript, PHP, and Python.
### *3.1 - The Beauty of the Standard Library*
- A language is a software for making software.
- The standard library is a set of premade software that you can reuse and reapply.
  - Python comes with tons of preexisting code organized into “modules” that you can reuse.
### *3.2 - What Do Different Languages Do?*
- Different codes structure data in different ways and address the components of the computer in different ways.
### *3.3 - The Importance of C*
- C is a big deal
- It’s the principle development language of the UNIX operating system
- C is computing like Latin is to Renaissance Academics
### *3.4 - The Corporate Object Revolution*
- Object-oriented programming is a filing system for code
- Object-oriented programming gave programmers a great way to name things
- Java is an object-oriented language, influenced by C++, that runs on a virtual machine (just like Smalltalk).
- Objective-C, per its name, jammed C and Smalltalk together with no apologies.
- C# (pronounced “C sharp”) is based on C and influenced by Java, but it was created by Microsoft for use in its .NET framework.
- C++ is an object-oriented version of C, although its roots are more in Simula.
### *3.5 - Look How Big and Weird Things Get With Just Python*
- Python has a reputation as a “glue language”
  - You can take code from other lower-level languages (like C, C++, Fortran 77) and write “wrapper functions”.
    - Embed the older, faster code in the newer slower, but easier-to-use system (Python)
## **4 - Why Are Coders Angry?**
### *4.1 - The Legend of the 10x Programmer*
- For a truly gifted programmer, writing code is a side effect of thought.
### *4.2 - The Thing About Real Artists Is That They...*
- As a class, programmers are easily bored, love novelty, and are obsessed with various forms of productivity enhancement.
### *4.3 - We Still Need to Choose…*
### *4.4 - Why Are There So Many Languages?*
- “Most programming languages are partly a way of expressing things in terms of other things and partly a basic set of given things” - P.J. Landin, 1966
## **5 - The Time You Attended the E-mail Address Validation Meeting**
### *5.1 - What Is the Relationship Between Code and Data?*
- Data management is the problem that programming is supposed to solve.
### *5.2 Where Does Data Live?*
- Amazon, Google, Yahoo!, Netflix, Spotify all have huge, powerful databases.
- The relational database uses a language called SQL (Structured Query Language)
  - Relational databases represent the world using tables, which have columns and rows.
  - IDs are important in databases
### *5.3 - The Language of White Collars*
- Java is object-oriented, but looks a lot like C and C++
- Java came with a lot of code already there
- It automatically generated documentation
### *5.4 - Briefly on the Huge Subject of Microsoft*
- Whatever is discussed in this issue, Microsoft offers at least one of it. Statically typed, scripting, data-driven, functional—name your ambiguous adjective, and Microsoft will sell something that delivers that to you, and you can write Windows code in it and live a Windows life.
### *5.5 - Liquid Infrastructure*
- Java is designed for big corporate projects and has the infrastructure to support them.
- People realize that if they didn't like the Java language, they could write other languages and run it on the Java virtual machine (JVM)
- Things are fluid in the world of programming.
  - Languages are liquid infrastructure
### *5.6 - Off the Shelf*
### *5.7 - What About Javascript?*
- JavaScript relationship with Java is tenuous. The strongest bond is their name.
- Google made their own browser “Chrome” with a super-fast JavaScript engine called V8
- NPM: Node Package Manager. Software that helped you install packages.
### *5.8 - What’s the Absolute Minimum I Must know About PHP?*
- PHP: Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter.
  - It powers Etsy, Wikipedia, and Facebook.
## **6 - How are Apps Made?**
- XCode: a program by Apple that is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
  - It’s how the company writes software and how anyone who wants to write software for Mac or iPhone does it.
  - One component is the iOS SDK (software development kit).
    - Use this to make iPhone/iPad apps.
  - You can compile everything with one command and up pops your software for testing.
- A lot of software to make software is free. It stimulates the development of even more software.
### *6.1 - The Framework: Wilder, Younger Cousin of the Software Development Kit*
- Frameworks lock you in a way of thinking.
  - Some people feel that frameworks make things too easy.
- Premature optimization: overthinking your code before you know what the real problems will be.
### *6.2 - What is Debugging?*
- Programming *is* debugging
- Stackoverflow is when a request goes too hard, for example, calling itself so many times that the stack, which is a finite resource, fills up and can’t take it anymore.
### *6.3 - Nothing is Built*
### *6.4 - How Does Testing Work?*
- Test-driven design is when programmers don’t start programming until they’ve written the tests that the code they hope to write must pass.
### *6.5 - And Now for Something Beautiful*
- Version control tracks every change, every test you have done.
- GitHub is great.
- Programmers hardly talk about code. They talk about data, interesting approaches, and constantly about deployment.
- Programmers want to ship and move on to the next problem ASAP so there are policies they follow to speed up the process:
  1. All programming work must happen in a branch.
  2. When work is done, we will merge it back into the main branch; and 
      - Run tests;
      - Then “push” the code over to GitHub.
  3. At which point an automated service will run; and
  4. A service running on each of the 50 computers will “check out” the code; and
  5. Install it, overwriting the old version;
  6. Then stop the computer’s Web servers;
  7. Then restart them, so the new code can load and get to work.
## **7 - The Triumph of Middle Management**
### *7.1 - How Do You Pick a Programming Language?*
- Beware of arguments related to programming speed.
- You need to figure out for yourself what kind of team you have, what kind of frameworks you like using, where people can be most productive, so they will stick around through the completion of the project.
- Clean code is idiomatic, as brief as possible, obvious even if it’s not heavily documented
- “A computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations … It is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” - *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.*
### *7.2 - Welcome to the Scrum*
### *7.3 - Managing Programmers*
- Agile methodology calls for regular coordination among programmers, providing a set of rituals and norms they can follow to make their programs work with the programs of others.
- The Agile Manifesto reads as follows:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan
### *7.4 - “We Are Going to Ship”*
- They will do their standups. And after the standups, they will go off and work in the integrated development environments and write their server-side JavaScript and their client-side JavaScript. Then they will run some tests and check their code into the source code repository, and the continuous integration server will perform tests and check
### *7.5 - Should You Learn Code?*
- Programming as a career can lead to a rewarding, solidly middle-class existence. If you are inclined and enjoy the work, it’s a good way to spend time, and if you work for and with good people, it can be very fun

This is for Intro to Programming Fall 2020.
I'm slightly confused to be quite honest.


# **WHAT IS CODE by Paul Ford**
## **1 - The Man in the Taupe Blazer**
- High executive is now in charge of rebuilding the company's website and managing coders. He is frustrated cause if something goes wrong, it’s his head getting cut off.
### *1.1 - Why are We Here?*
- 11 million software developers in the world
  - 7 million hobbyists
- This is Ford's view of software development, as an individual among millions.
## **2 - Let's Begin**
### *2.1 - How Do You Type an "A"?*
- Computer waits for a signal from the keyboard. When the key is pressed, the computer interprets it and passes it farther into its own interior.
- Coders are willing to work backwards to that key press.
### *2.2 - From Hardware to Software*
- If coders don’t run the world, they run the things that run the world.
- Hardware used to be separate from software (buy and computer + the software separately), but now when you buy a computer it comes with all the functions already installed.
### *2.3 - How does Code Become Software?*
- Code: a sequence of symbols that someone typed in, or copied, or pasted from elsewhere. Software developers are handed a problem, think about the problem, write code that will solve the problem, and then expect the computer to turn words into deeds.
- Goal is to turn your code into an explicit list of instructions that can be carried out by interconnected logic gates (software)
- A compiler: software that takes the symbols you typed into a file and transforms them into lower-level instructions.
- Every single character matters. A small mistake can leave your computer in a state of panic.
### *2.4 - What is an Algorithm?*
- An algorithm solves a problem.
- Euclid’s algorithm page.
- A programming language is a system for encoding, naming, and organizing algorithms for reuse and application. An algorithm management system.
- The hardest work in programming is getting around things that aren't computable.
- Programming languages have 2 jobs
  1. Wrap up lots of algorithms so they can be reused.
  2. Make it easy for programmers to wrap up new algorithms and routines into functions for reuse.
- The DRY principle: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Name things once, do things once, create a function once, and let the computer repeat itself.
### *2.5 - The Sprint*
- Wireframe mock-ups: pictures of how the website will look.
### *2.6 - What's With all These Conferences, Anyway?*
- Technology conferences are where primate Dynamics can be fully displayed, we're relationships of power and hierarchy can be established.
- There were loads of sexual misconduct against women. They started documenting it, and now there are rules and codes of conduct for people to follow.
- Less than 30% of people in Computing are women, the number of women in Computing has fallen since the 80s

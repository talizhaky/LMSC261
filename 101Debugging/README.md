#Chessboard Assignment

It was all fun and games until I wrote out the whole code, sure it would work, and then **bam**. Nothing. It was long, unorganized, and I knew that starting over would make my life a whole lot easier. So that's what I did. I started googling different JavaScript functions and found [this](https://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_functions.asp) website. I found the "repeat" function and then went on another website to learn how to use [repeat()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/repeat).

Nice, now I'm onto something. But then...
I was having a **huge** problem when I ran my code in
the JavaScript console it would work perfectly and give me a beautiful chessboard. BUT, then I'd run the same exact code again and I'd get a *"Identifier X has already been declared"* message. So frustrating. I even was about to email Rachel (I still have that email in my drafts I think) for help. Before I did that I did one last trip to Google and found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36140252/browser-identifier-x-has-already-been-declared) forum on StackOverflow. A life saver.
So, what I decided to do was move my variables into my for loop block. It works! (Not totally sure why though).

Anyways, enjoy my Chessboard!

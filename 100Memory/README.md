# FizzBuzz

At first, this was pretty easy. I figured out quickly how to make an integer
that's divisible by 3 write "Fizz", an integer divisible by 5 write "Buzz", and
an integer divisble by *both* 3 and 5 write "FizzBuzz".

The hard part is making the counter stop at 100. I keep getting the counter to
go until 101. I have yet to figure out how to make it stop at 100.

## Sunday, 10:15pm UPDATE:

I figured out how to make the counter stop at 100 (Buzz). I added in the *"if integer is divisible by 5"* block a "break" once the number becomes 101. That's because I knew that 100 was divisble by 5 and therefore the program would be in that part of the for loop. (I hope this makes sense). Anyways, time for bed.

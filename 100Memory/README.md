# FizzBuzz

At first, this was pretty easy. I figured out quickly how to make an integer
that's divisible by 3 write "Fizz", an integer divisible by 5 write "Buzz", and
an integer divisble by *both* 3 and 5 write "FizzBuzz".

The hard part is making the counter stop at 100. I keep getting the counter to
go until 101. I have yet to figure out how to make it stop at 100.

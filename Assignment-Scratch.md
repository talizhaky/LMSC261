## *Why I decided to create this scratch*
First of all, I wanted to make my scratch interactive. Somewhat like a game where it's possible to have different users get different experiences.
Next, I used the penguin because I thought it looked adorable.
If you look inside the code you can see that I used "the create your own block" function. When I did the Stanford Code in Place course the main takeaway I got was to try to keep your code as organized as possible. So, although the *"Greg in Space"* or *"Go to starting position"* blocks weren't necessary to make a successful program, it help me debug while I was in the process of coding.

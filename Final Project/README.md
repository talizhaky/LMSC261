# Final Project Proposal

It's 5am and you're running late to work. It's still pitch black outside so it's hard to tell what the weather will be like much less what to wear. Thank God for the handy-dandy weather widget on your iPhone that tells you it's going to be 64 degrees with 15mph winds and some showers towards the end of the day. Unfortunately you don't know what heck that actually feels like to you and you're stuck picking a quick outfit and praying it won't fail you.

Well, what if there was a personalized program that tells you exactly what YOU should wear based on the weather? Soon there will be because that's my Final Project. This program will be useful for anyone who lives where there is weather.

**Resources**
I'm going to create this Weather Program in Python and call upon *many* resources to help. Here are some that I've used so far:
- Originally I used [Dress for the Weather](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/dress-for-the-weather) instructions from Raspberrypi but then found it to be outdated.
- [PyOWM](https://pyowm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): a client Python wrapper library for OpenWeatherMap web APIs. It allows quick and easy consumption of OWM data from Python applications via a simple object model and in a human-friendly fashion.
- [Code Recipes](https://pyowm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v3/code-recipes.html#library_init): shows how to use PyOWM and make it your own.
- [This Github](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm) that describes how to use PyOWM
- [OpenWeatherMap](openweathermap.org): This open source weather map gives you an API for free to link to your Program

**Proposed Timeline:**
| Mission                                                                          | Date to be completed |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:--------------------:|
| Have code work so you can put in your location and it will give you weather      | Nov. 30              |
| Finish substantial questionnaire that determines your profile                    | Dec. 5               |
| Combine questionnaire data and weather data to give users their suggested outfit | Dec. 9               |
| Create a mock-up of how the website or app *would* look if pursued               | Dec. 13              |
| If time, create website for weather program                                      | Dec. 14              |

**How I Should Be Assessed:**
I should be assessed on the following criteria:
1. User interface, how easy is it for someone to use my program
2. How well does the program work (any errors? misunderstandings?)
3. How accurate/helpful was this program?

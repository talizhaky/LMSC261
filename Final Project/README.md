#Final Project Proposal

It's 5am and you're running late to work. It's still pitch black outside so it's hard to tell what the weather will be like much less what to wear. Thank God for the handy-dandy weather widget on your iPhone that tells you it's going to be 64 degrees with 15mph winds and some showers towards the end of the day. Unfortunately you don't know what heck that actually feels like to you and you're stuck picking a quick outfit and praying it won't fail you.

Well, what if there was a personalized program that tells you exactly what YOU should wear based on the weather? Soon there will be because that's my Final Project.

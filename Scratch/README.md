## *Why I decided to create this scratch*
I wanted to make my scratch interactive. Somewhat like a "choose your own adventure" game.
## *How I made the code*
I started off by coming up with my idea. I wanted to have a clear end goal before I began or else I would get lost and frustrated. I also made sure to keep my code as organized as possible by using the "Create your own block" function. When I took the Stanford "Code in Place" coarse, they expressed how important it was to keep your code organized.
## *Problems I faced and how I overcame them*
The first problem I faced was not knowing how to use the user's answer. For example, when Greg asks for the user's name, I couldn't figure out how to then *use* that name. I almost gave up that idea but then decided to do further research. I watched a couple Youtube videos and went on a Scratch forum and then learned how to use the "join" function in "operators".
I couldn't figure out how to make the planet and diver glide in and then leave the scene without just placing them far up in the corner. Then, I learned about the "hide" and "show" buttons.
Another problem I faced was accidentally creating a never-ending loop. By using variables I was able to control durations of events (like how long the planet and diver were in the scene).
## *What code did I use from others?*
Although I didn't use code from any other programmers, I used their examples to familiarize myself with Scratch and learn how to utilize different functions.

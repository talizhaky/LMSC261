# Creating a Website

Jason, Sam, Sophie, and I created a band called "Atom's Apple". You can check out our website [here](https://talizhaky.github.io/)

We decided to meet on Monday during regular class time to get everything done. Although it was hard to get organized in the beginning things *were* running smoothly... until Sophie couldn't merge anything and I ended up using Jekyll by accident. Luckily, Rachel came in at the end of our meeting and helped clean things up a bit.

Everyone was in charge of adding their own bio, picking an instrument, and then sending over a photo to Jason to add to the website. I was also in charge of figuring out how to make a CSS file and make the website look pretty. After an hour of trying to figure things out, we (Rachel) realized that I had been working in Jekyll. I thought Jekyll was just a Github sub-site but apparently it's a coding language.

Building a website from scratch is a lot harder than I thought it would be. However, I do see why people opt to DIY a website instead of using Wix or Squarespace. You have more creative freedom and can insure that your website is unique.
